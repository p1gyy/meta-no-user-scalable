**Meta Viewport Adder** was created to solve a problem I had when using my favorite browser *Firefox*, my goal is not to dedicate myself to add features in the short or long term.

This extension also adds the meta no-user-scalable tag and sets it's value to 0. This effectively prevents firefox's double-tap to zoom feature.

If **you** want to add any feature, improve the code, etc; you can feel free to do so.

Find it in:
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/meta-viewport-adder/ "Firefox").

If there is a **native** way to do it in Firefox (such as about:config), please notify me and I will remove it.

All credit goes to "imheinrichlunge" for the original extension. I have modified it to remove the double tap functionality too, as well as adding the meta viewport tag.
